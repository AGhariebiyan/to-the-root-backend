# How to start the app

When we start this app two processes will run simultaneously:
1. one-community-fe Nuxt front end client
2. sanity-studio instance 

In the one-community folder (one-community/one-community) lives the frontend. Run "npm run dev" there to start up the frontend on localhost:3000 (by default)
In the one-community-backend folder (one-community/one-community) lives the backend. Run "npm run develop" there to start up the backend on localhost:1337 (by default)

Take the env.example, make a copy and turn it into a .env file.

You can change the locations in your .env file if you like.
